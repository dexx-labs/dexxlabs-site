    <p><span class="highlight">update:</span> our private ai dev cohort (summer '25) is live. final project demos by late july.</p>

    <p>deXX Labs is a builder-first, ops-obsessed, reality-bending ai engineering cell. we aren't here to chase trends. we exist to architect next-gen intelligence — lean, fast, and free from bureaucracy.</p>

    <p>we are launching with one program, one direction, and one outcome: <span class="highlight">autonomous engineering agents</span>.</p>

    <p>we call it <strong>dexx</strong>: deployed engineering for xenointelligent systems. that's our name, our north star, and our core protocol.</p>

    <p>we treat ai progress as an engineering challenge, not a philosophical one. every model, every line of code, every commit pushes us toward the frontier — safely, but without drag.</p>

    <p>our current initiative is the <span class="highlight"><strong>dexx ai dev program</strong></span>, a stealth-mode summer builder track focused on building real-world ai tools, from scratch to ship.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">fellows:</span> will be released soon...</p>

    <p>we are not open to the public yet. we're heads-down, scaling in silence.</p>

    <p>DeXX Labs is headquartered online, operated globally, and engineered in india. no offices. just output.</p>

    <p>if you're a builder, drop your email. we'll ping you when we're ready to break shit together.</p>

    <p>– the dexx team<br>june 2025</p>
